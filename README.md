# Welcome to MrBrackhaus' GitHub! 🎉

## About Me

Hi there! I'm **MrBrackhaus**, a passionate IT professional with a deep love for **cybersecurity** 🔐, **network infrastructure** 🖧, and **cloud architecture** ☁️. I've been adventuring through **Pen & Paper role-playing games** 🎲 like **DSA**, **Shadowrun**, **Call of Cthulhu**, and **Cyberpunk** for over 30 years, exploring fantasy worlds while conquering real-world tech challenges!

In addition to my professional journey, I’m the kind of person who went out of my way to get the **Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification** 📜just so I can confidently tell people that **this product isn’t all it's cracked up to be**. Yes, **I did it for you** 😏.

When I’m not neck deep in code, you’ll find me **taking long walks by the lake** 🌅, working on my **strength training** 💪, or sipping on a **perfect cup of coffee** ☕ (trust me, coffee makes all the difference). Also, I’m a trained **Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration**, which means I’ve got the knowledge and experience to build reliable, secure IT systems from the ground up. 🛠️

- **Cybersecurity** 🔐: Proactive defense, system hardening, and ethical hacking.
- **Networking** 🖧: Building robust network infrastructures using OPNsense, pfSense, and WireGuard.
- **Cloud Solutions** ☁️: Designing scalable architectures on AWS, Azure (even though it pains me to say so), and Proxmox.
- **DevOps & Automation** ⚙️: Leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines to streamline operations.
- **Linux Systems** 🐧: Advanced knowledge of Linux distributions, server management, and scripting.

## Current Projects

## Personal Interests

Outside of the tech world, you'll find me:

- **Rolling dice** 🎲 in a good old **Pen & Paper RPG** with friends.
- Enjoying **walks by the lake** 🌅 to refresh my mind.
- Staying active with **strength training** 💪.
- Always on the hunt for the **perfect cup of coffee** ☕ (seriously, it’s a lifestyle).
